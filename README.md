# Admin Dashboard

A full dashboard layout created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project involved recreating a complex dashboard design to practice advanced CSS Grid techniques.

**Note:** This web page has no interactive functionality. The navigation links and buttons are present for visual purposes only.

## Skills Learned

### HTML
* **Semantic Structure**
  * Organized dashboard sections with semantic elements
  * Learned trade-offs between semantic HTML and styling nested descendants with CSS
* **SVG Implementation**
  * Integrated SVG icons as external image files
  * Learned trade-offs between embedded and linked SVGs

### CSS Layout
* **CSS Grid Mastery**
  * Built complex multi-column dashboard layout
  * Created responsive card grids with `auto-fit` and `minmax()`
  * Used named grid areas for intuitive layout structure
* **Grid vs Flexbox Decisions**
  * Applied Grid for 2D layout control (main dashboard structure)
  * Used Flexbox for 1D content flow (navigation items, button groups)

### CSS Techniques
* **Modern CSS Reset**
  * Implemented `modern-normalize` for consistent cross-browser styling
  * Added custom reset rules based on common pain points
* **CSS Custom Properties**
  * Created reusable avatar size variable
* **Pseudo-classes**
  * Used `:first-child` and `:last-child` for border styling
